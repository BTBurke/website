# Auth

By default, clients must be authorized with a token to use the local keysd service.

The `keys` client reads the auth token from the `KEYS_AUTH` environment variable.

For more details on how auth works, see [specs/auth](../specs/auth.md).

## `keys auth`

The first time you run `keys auth`, it will ask you to setup a password.
Running `keys auth` gives you a token which is available for the life of the local service process.

```shell
keys auth

OK, let's create a password.
Create a password:
Re-enter the password:

export KEYS_AUTH="AbGNXgc4aK9x1b1pHlOLZ33meXyv796DyWK5jHqiS1R"
# To output an auth token:
#  keys auth -token
#
# To include in a shell environment:
#  export KEYS_AUTH=`keys auth -token`
#
# or using eval:
#  eval $(keys auth)
#
# For Powershell:
#  $env:KEYS_AUTH = (keys auth -token)
```

If you are in a a bash/zsh environment, you can run:

```shell
> eval $(keys auth)
# or
> export KEYS_AUTH=`keys auth -token`
```
